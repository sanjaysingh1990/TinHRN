# Fixing Google OAuth Redirect Issue

## Problem Summary

You're experiencing an issue where Google authentication works but the app doesn't properly redirect back after successful authentication. The error message is: "something went wrong trying to finish signing in. please close this screen to go back to the app" and in the app it shows "Google signin was cancelled or failed".

Additionally, you received an error that the redirect URI "tinhrn://oauthredirect" is invalid because it doesn't end with a public top-level domain.

## Root Cause

Google OAuth has strict requirements for redirect URIs:
1. They must use HTTPS protocol
2. They must end with a valid public top-level domain (like .com, .org, etc.)

Custom scheme URIs (like `tinhrn://oauthredirect`) are not accepted by Google, which is why you're getting the error.

## Solution Steps

### 1. Update Google Cloud Console Redirect URIs

Based on your app configuration, you need to add this exact redirect URI to your Google Cloud Console OAuth 2.0 client:

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Select your project
3. Navigate to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials"
4. Find your OAuth 2.0 Client ID for web application (or create one if it doesn't exist)
5. Under "Authorized redirect URIs", add ONLY this URI:
```
https://auth.expo.io/@sanjubisht/TiNHRn
```
6. REMOVE any custom scheme URIs (like `tinhrn://oauthredirect`) from the list
7. Click "Save"

### 2. Verify App Configuration

I've already updated your [SocialAuthService.ts](file:///Users/sanjaysinghbisht/Desktop/workspace/cli-gemini/TiNHRn/src/features/auth/data/services/SocialAuthService.ts) to use the correct redirect URI that Google will accept.

Check that your `app.json` has the correct scheme:
```json
{
  "expo": {
    "scheme": "tinhrn",
    // ... other configuration
  }
}
```

### 3. Wait for Propagation

After updating the redirect URIs in Google Cloud Console, wait 5-10 minutes for the changes to propagate.

### 4. Test the Fix

1. Restart your Expo development server
2. Try Google Sign In again
3. Check the console logs for any error messages

## Additional Debugging Steps

### Check Exact Redirect URI Being Used

The app is now configured to use `https://auth.expo.io/@sanjubisht/TiNHRn` which Google will accept.

### Enable Detailed Logging

I've added detailed logging to track the OAuth flow in [SocialAuthService.ts](file:///Users/sanjaysinghbisht/Desktop/workspace/cli-gemini/TiNHRn/src/features/auth/data/services/SocialAuthService.ts).

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: Mismatched Redirect URIs
**Solution**: Ensure you're using ONLY the Expo auth proxy URI (`https://auth.expo.io/@username/projectslug`) for Google OAuth.

### Issue 2: Custom Scheme URIs Rejected by Google
**Solution**: Remove any custom scheme URIs from Google Cloud Console as Google only accepts HTTPS URLs.

### Issue 3: Network Issues
**Solution**: Ensure you have a stable internet connection during the OAuth flow.

## If the Problem Persists

1. Check the Expo logs for the exact error message
2. Verify that the Google Client ID in your code matches the one in Google Cloud Console
3. Ensure your Google OAuth 2.0 client is properly configured as a "Web application"
4. Make sure you're testing on a device or simulator, not the web browser

## Contact Support

If you're still experiencing issues after following these steps:

1. Open an issue on the Expo GitHub repository
2. Check the Expo forums for similar issues
3. Contact Google Cloud support for OAuth configuration questions
