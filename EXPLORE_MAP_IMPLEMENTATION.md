# Explore Map Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented full-screen map functionality in the explore section using react-native-maps.

## Changes Made

### 1. Installed Dependencies
- Added `react-native-maps` package for native map functionality
- Updated `app.json` with react-native-maps plugin configuration

### 2. Map Configuration (app.json)
```json
[
  "react-native-maps",
  {
    "googleMapsApiKey": "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE",
    "enableGoogleMaps": true
  }
]
```

### 3. Updated Components

#### MapViewExploreScreen.tsx
- **Full-screen map**: Map now covers the entire screen behind all UI elements
- **Real markers**: Replaced placeholder markers with actual map markers using `react-native-maps`
- **Interactive controls**: Added functional zoom in/out controls
- **Location animation**: Map animates to selected locations when markers are pressed
- **User location**: Shows user's current location on the map

Key features:
- Position: Map positioned absolutely to fill entire screen
- Markers: Custom markers with location icons and colors
- Animation: Smooth region changes when interacting with locations
- Controls: Overlay zoom controls positioned on the right side

#### ExploreMapContent.tsx  
- **Similar full-screen implementation** for the tabbed explore view
- **Layered UI**: Search bar positioned at top with transparent background
- **Bottom sheet**: Location cards positioned at bottom as overlay
- **Background map**: Map serves as background for all UI elements

### 4. Key Features Implemented

#### Full-Screen Map Display
- Map fills entire container behind all views
- UI elements overlay on top of the map
- Maintains proper z-index layering

#### Interactive Map Elements
- **Zoom Controls**: Custom zoom in/out buttons
- **Location Markers**: Interactive markers for each explore location  
- **Map Animation**: Smooth transitions when selecting locations
- **Region Updates**: Map region updates based on user interactions

#### UI Layout
- **Search Bar**: Positioned at top as overlay
- **Bottom Cards**: Horizontal scroll of location cards at bottom
- **Controls**: Zoom controls positioned on right side
- **Header**: Navigation header (for full-screen map page)

### 5. Map Provider Configuration
- Uses Google Maps provider (`PROVIDER_GOOGLE`)
- Shows user location with built-in controls
- Enables rotation and pitch gestures
- Configures initial region to Himalayas area

### 6. Marker Customization
- Custom marker design with primary color background
- Location icon (place icon) in center
- White border for better visibility
- Interactive press handling for location selection

## Usage
1. **Tab Navigation**: Access via Explore tab â†’ Map view
2. **Full Screen**: Access via map-explore route for dedicated map experience
3. **Interactions**: 
   - Tap markers to select locations
   - Use zoom controls for map navigation
   - Scroll bottom cards to browse locations
   - Search locations using top search bar

## Note
Remember to replace `"YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"` in app.json with an actual Google Maps API key for production use.

## Testing
The app successfully builds and runs with the new map implementation. All explore functionality remains intact while providing a enhanced map experience.
