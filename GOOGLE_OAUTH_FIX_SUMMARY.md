# Google OAuth Redirect Fix - Summary

## Changes Made

1. **Enhanced SocialAuthService.ts**:
   - Fixed redirect URI handling to use only Google-accepted HTTPS URLs
   - Configured the app to use the Expo auth proxy for Google OAuth
   - Kept custom scheme URIs for Facebook OAuth (which is more flexible)
   - Added better logging for debugging
   - Added PKCE for better security

2. **Updated app.json**:
   - Ensured proper scheme configuration
   - Added bundleIdentifier for iOS

3. **Enhanced SocialButtons.tsx**:
   - Added loading state during authentication
   - Improved error messages with specific guidance
   - Added better user feedback during the auth process

4. **Enhanced AuthRepository.ts**:
   - Added more specific error messages for redirect issues
   - Improved logging for debugging

5. **Created Documentation Files**:
   - GOOGLE_OAUTH_REDIRECT_URIS.md - Lists exact URIs to add to Google Cloud Console
   - FIX_GOOGLE_OAUTH_REDIRECT.md - Comprehensive guide to fix the issue

## Immediate Action Required

To fix the Google OAuth redirect issue, you MUST add this exact redirect URI to your Google Cloud Console OAuth 2.0 Client ID:

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Select your project
3. Navigate to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials"
4. Find your OAuth 2.0 Client ID for web application
5. Under "Authorized redirect URIs", add this URI:
   ```
   https://auth.expo.io/@sanjubisht/TiNHRn
   ```
6. REMOVE any custom scheme URIs (like `tinhrn://oauthredirect`) as Google will reject them
7. Click "Save"

## Why This Fixes the Issue

Google OAuth only accepts redirect URIs that:
1. Use HTTPS protocol
2. End with a valid public top-level domain (like .com, .org, etc.)

The Expo auth proxy URL (`https://auth.expo.io/@username/projectslug`) meets these requirements and works for all environments (Expo Go, development, and standalone apps).

## Wait for Propagation

After updating the redirect URIs in Google Cloud Console, WAIT 5-10 minutes for the changes to propagate before testing.

## Testing the Fix

1. Restart your Expo development server
2. Try Google Sign In again
3. Check the console logs for any error messages

## If the Problem Persists

1. Check the Expo logs for the exact error message
2. Verify that the Google Client ID in your code matches the one in Google Cloud Console
3. Ensure your Google OAuth 2.0 client is properly configured as a "Web application"
